# Company Management Service

## Description

This project is a Company Management Service built with Go. It provides a RESTful API for managing company information, user authentication, and includes features such as event sourcing using an outbox pattern with Kafka integration.

Key features:
- CRUD operations for company management
- User registration and authentication with JWT
- Event sourcing using outbox pattern
- Kafka integration for event publishing
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Docker support for easy deployment and development

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/company-management-service.git
   cd company-management-service
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   make run
   ```
   

The application and all its dependencies (PostgreSQL, Kafka, etc.) will start up using Docker Compose.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints with curl examples:

### User Registration

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "newuser", "password": "password123"}'
```

### User Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "newuser", "password": "password123"}'
```

This will return a JWT token to use for authenticated requests.

### Create Company

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/companies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "name": "Tech Corp",
    "description": "Innovative technology solutions",
    "amount_of_employees": 100,
    "registered": true,
    "type": "Corporations"
  }'
```

Note: The `id` field should be a valid UUID generated by the client.

### Get Company

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/companies/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Update Company

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/v1/companies/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Tech Corp",
    "amount_of_employees": 150
  }'
```

### Delete Company

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/companies/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```
